As part of your submission, update this file with answers:

#### 1. Which API did you choose?

PHP-Noise

#### 2. What inputs do you supply in your API request?

Color via Hex Code, Image size, Tile size and border width, brightness multiplier and brightness steps. Color calculation is automatically set to Brightness mode.

#### 3. What did you do for the "Beyond Baseline" requirement?

I tried to make an interface that did more than just provide direct communication between the user and the API, giving the user different interpretations of each setting that would ideally turn the use of the website into more of an explorative journey than plain tinkering with dials.

#### 4. What gave you difficulty with this assignment?

Making the website look and (cosmetically) behave how I wanted it to; CSS to me feels like a bottomless rabbit hole I don't like delving into often.

#### 5. What are you proud of with this assignment?

I like how if you play along with the conceit of the website (giving responses to pretty much nonsense prompts to get a cohesive output), it really feels like you get a surprise every time that still feels reasonable.
